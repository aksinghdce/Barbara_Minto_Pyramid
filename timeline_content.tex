\section{Appendix}

I drew a timeline that shows chronological events. I also plotted the \%-change in sales YoY. There is a clear relationship between the geopolitical events mentioned in the timeline and the dip in \%-change in sales. This shows the interdependence of consumer perception of a brannd, the media agencies that influence this perception and how these factors interact with a business's performance. \\
