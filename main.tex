\renewcommand{\abstractname}{Executive Summary}
\begin{abstract}
A Short-Term strategy is to reach a mutual agreement with Venkat. The process of mutual agree must be based on mutual respect and it must not be founded on the ideas of exerting purchasing power to force Venkat into compliance.Long-Term strategy is to form alliances with consortiums to nutralize threat from hostile organizations.\\
There are three main benefits of redefined relationship between IKEA and its suppliers. They are - \\
\begin{enumerate*}
 \item Brand-Image improved by appealing to customer's sentiments,
 \item Cost-savings improved by increase in control-surface on supplier's business processes,
 \item Improved management of risks associated with environmental and social resources.
\end{enumerate*} \\
Three main concerns that can be raised are - \\
\begin{enumerate*}
 \item Strict compliance requires exhaustive monitoring because compliance is difficult to validate in the real world. I present a supporting quote from a recent research - "central premise is that the total amount of control people are subjected to, relative to the control they can exercise, will affect the probability and type of their deviant behavior." \cite{tittle2018control}
 \item Tighter control on suppliers can lead to coupling of supposedly-independent business models. This is against the fundamental system-architecture principles.
 \item IKEA's business model is tightly coupled with geopolitical dynamics. This is a huge accounting liability.
\end{enumerate*}
\end{abstract}
\section{Situation}
Since 1993, when "Child Labor Deterrance Act" was proposed in US Congress, IKEA has been setting up \textbf{policies and practices} to closely \textbf{monitor its suppliers}. The efforts of IKEA has lead to its redefined relationship with its suppliers. According to reports, \textbf{benefits and concerns} associated with the aforementioned policies and practices, are fundamental to IKEA's business, in particular, and to international socioeconomic structure, in general.
\section{Complications}
Governance and administrative structures of South Asian countries are unlike those of the Western Civilization. Populous countries like the ones in South Asia have a complex socioeconomic model. The administrative structure in these regions of the world are founded in well recognized structures that define how work is done in the organization that originate and operate within the cultural backdrop of the inhabitants of these regions.
The enforcement of IWAY policies and practices has been effective but it can not guarantee compliance. A potential reason is that of the complexity of buiness models specific to the suppliers in South Asia. Controlling these models with mandate is a wishful thinking because of the estimatably large cost of validating the business transactions in a complex socioeconomic model.

\section{Proposed Solution}
A Short-Term strategy is to reach a mutual agreement with Venkat. The process of mutual agree must be based on mutual respect and it must not be founded on the ideas of exerting purchasing power to force Venkat into compliance. Long-Term strategy is to form alliances with consortiums to nutralize threat from hostile organizations. This scenario is presenting concerns from different control groups and stakeholders from multiple interdependent organizations, so a careful understanding of the needs of the stakeholders is key to a meaningful strategy.

\section{Questions}
I question IKEA's decision to reject Rugmark Consortium's invitation to join the Consortium. Given the fact that it was the best option of that time. \cite{publichearing1998}

"..the success or failure of early nineteenth-century child labor laws depended on these actorsâ€™ social skill, pragmatic creativity, and goal-directedness." \cite{anderson2018policy} Here "actors" refers to "elite policy entrepreneurs".
