\begin{abstract}
This article attempts to estimate the \textbf{goal}, \textbf{short-term actions} and \textbf{long-term strategies} that Marianne Barner \textbf{needs to decide} to deal with a continuing problem that reveals iteself with respect to IKEA's code of conduct (IWAY).
\end{abstract}
\section{Situation}
Since 1993, when "Child Labor Deterrance Act" was proposed in US Congress, IKEA has been setting up \textbf{policies and practices} to closely \textbf{monitor its suppliers}. The efforts of IKEA has lead to its redefined relationship with its suppliers. According to reports, \textbf{benefits and concerns} associated with the aforementioned policies and practices, are fundamental to IKEA's business, in particular, and with international socioeconomic structure, in general.
\section{Complications}
"central premise is that the total amount of control people are subjected to, relative to the control they can exercise, will affect the probability and type of their deviant behavior." \cite{tittle2018control}
\section{Questions}
I question IKEA's decision to reject Rugmark Consortium's invitation to join the Consortium. Given the fact that it was the best option of that time. \cite{publichearing1998}

"..the success or failure of early nineteenth-century child labor laws depended on these actorsâ€™ social skill, pragmatic creativity, and goal-directedness." \cite{anderson2018policy} Here "actors" refers to "elite policy entrepreneurs".
