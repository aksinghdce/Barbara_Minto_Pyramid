\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Short term action:}conduct recurring meetings with Venkat to reach \textbf{mutual agreement}. The agreement would list the top three concerns that resist compliance with IWAY. \textbf{Finer point:}The process of mutual agree must be based on mutual respect and it must not be founded on the ideas of exerting purchasing power to force Venkat into compliance. \cite{tittle2018control} \\\textbf{Long term strategy:} IWAY policies and practices should be revised to work with consortiums to nutralize threat to IKEA's value chain.\footnote{ from hostile organizations that deploy intended and organized attacks.} \cite{publichearing1998}\\
There are \textbf{three main benefits} of redefined relationship between IKEA and its suppliers - \\
\begin{enumerate*}
 \item \textbf{Brand-Image Improved}\footnote{Competitive advantage by forward integration: by appealing to customer's sentiments} ,
 \item \textbf{Cost Savings Improved}\footnote{Competitive advantage by backward integration : by increase in IKEA's control-surface on supplier's business processes},
 \item \textbf{Improved management of risks}\footnote{Sustainability and Collaborative advantage: associated with environmental and social resources.}
\end{enumerate*} \\
Three main concerns that can be raised are - \\
\begin{enumerate*}
 \item \textbf{New cost} to meet the requirements of strict compliance.\footnote{ requires exhaustive monitoring, which is expensive in many dimensions. Because, compliance is difficult to validate in the real world. I present a supporting quote from a recent research - "central premise is that the total amount of control people are subjected to, relative to the control they can exercise, will affect the probability and type of their deviant behavior." \cite{tittle2018control}}
 \item \textbf{Threat to sales:}stronger control on suppliers would affect IKEA's business. \footnote{tighter coupling of business models is not recommended. This is against the fundamental  principles of system architecture.}
 \item \textbf{Accounting liability:}IKEA's business model is tightly coupled with geopolitical dynamics. This is a huge accounting liability in terms of potential litigations.
\end{enumerate*}
