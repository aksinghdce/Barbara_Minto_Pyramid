\renewcommand{\abstractname}{Executive Summary}
\begin{abstract}
\textbf{Short term action plan:}conduct recurring meetings with Venkat to reach \textbf{mutual agreement}. The agreement would list the top three concerns inhibiting compliance with IWAY. \textbf{Finer point:}The process of mutual agreement must be based on mutual respect \cite{smeltzer1997meaning} and it must be founded on the ideas of Authoritative, Affiliative and Democratic style of leadership \cite{goleman2000leadership} to nudge \cite{leonard2008richard} Venkat into compliance. \cite{tittle2018control} \cite{inderst2011countervailing} \\\textbf{Long term strategy:} IWAY policies and practices should be revised to work with consortiums to neutralize threat to IKEA's value chain.\footnote{ from hostile organizations that deploy intended and organized attacks.} \cite{publichearing1998_183}\\
There are \textbf{three main benefits} of redefined relationship between IKEA and its suppliers - \\
\begin{enumerate*}
 \item \textbf{Brand-Image Improved}\footnote{Competitive advantage by forward integration: by appealing to customer's sentiments} ,
 \item \textbf{Cost Savings Improved}\footnote{Competitive advantage by backward integration : by increase in IKEA's control-surface on supplier's business processes},
 \item \textbf{Improved management of risks}\footnote{Sustainability and Collaborative advantage: associated with environmental and social resources.}
\end{enumerate*} \\
Three main concerns that can be raised are - \\
\begin{enumerate*}
 \item \textbf{New cost} to meet the requirements of strict compliance.\footnote{ requires exhaustive monitoring, which is expensive in many dimensions. Because, compliance is difficult to validate in the real world. I present a supporting quote from a recent research - "central premise is that the total amount of control people are subjected to, relative to the control they can exercise, will affect the probability and type of their deviant behavior." }\footnote{tighter coupling of business models is not recommended. This is against the fundamental  principles of system architecture.}\cite{tittle2018control}
 \item \textbf{Threat to sales:} misalignment of IKEA's goals with those of the media that influences customers would affect IKEA's business. 
 \item \textbf{Accounting liability:}IKEA's business model is tightly coupled with geopolitical dynamics. This is a huge accounting liability in terms of potential litigations.
\end{enumerate*}
\end{abstract}

\section{Reasoning}
\begin{enumerate*}
\item To ensure \textbf{better yet cost effective IWAY compliance}, intensity of supplier-monitoring must not scale proportional to IKEA's sales. \textbf{Scale and complexity of IKEA's supplier base as a whole is directly proportional to IKEA's sales}. IKEA should \textbf{aim to decouple from complexity of its suppliers to keep cost of monitoring independent}. One practical solution to mitigate the proportional rise of cost is to \textbf{collaborate with local organizations that understand local socioeconomic structure}. This reasoning feeds into short time actions that IKEA must undertake.
\item In order to mitigate threat to sales, IKEA works with other organizations like - "Swedish Work Group for Abolishment of Child Labour in the Carpet Industry", "Swedish Save the children", and "International Labour Organisation"\cite{publichearing1998_479}. IKEA must actively collaborate with the activism groups in Sweden and those that operate at international organizations. This will ensure competitive advantage by forward integration \cite{harrigan1985vertical}. This reasoning feeds into long term strategy along with the next and final point.
\item IKEA must look at IWAY as a control system that evolves with appropriate deployment of a feedback from geopolitical events.
